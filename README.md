# Bernly

Bernly is a link (URL) shortener. When you provide it with a long link like "docs.behat.org/en/v3.0/quick_intro_pt1.html", it will give a shorter link like "bern.ly/3" back to you. When anyone follows the short link, the Bernly web server will redirect them to the long link.

## Benefits

### Easier sharing of links

* Many places on the Internet where links are shared, place a limit on the number of characters    allowed in the message text that contain the links. For example, on Twitter, a tweet is limited to 140 characters, and an SMS, to 160 characters. By shortening the link, more characters are available for the rest of the message.
* Manually copying a short link requires less typing than a long link.
* A long link might be wider than the user-interface element displaying the text that contains it, but a short link has much better chance of fitting inside it.
